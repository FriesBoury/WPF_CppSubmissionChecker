# WPF_CppSubmissionChecker
WPF application that speeds up the checking process of a large number of C++ Projects
This tool allows you to check student submissions one by one, without the need of unpacking everything first.

<h1>Usage instructions</h1>
Download the <b>submissions.zip</b> from the assignment you want to check and open it in the CppSubmissionChecker.
Every submission inside the submissions.zip should be a .zip file where the name starts with the studentname_ 
(.rar or .7z are also supported, but may give unstable results).

<h2>First Use</h2>
The first time the program is started, the preferences window will open.
There you can select the Visual Studio Location and a Temp Folder Location.
These settings <b>must be configured</b> before you can use the application.

<h2>Temp Folder</h2>
The temp folder will be used to unpack the submissions to.
A folder /SubmissionChecker will be created inside that folder.
Every time a new submission gets opened, the /SubmissionChecker folder will be cleaned to prevent cluttering your disk.
